"""Module to define the SessionAuth class for session-based
    authentication.

This module defines the SessionAuth class, which inherits from
    the Auth base class.
Currently, this class is a placeholder and does not implement
    any authentication logic.
It serves as the initial step towards creating a new authentication
    mechanism based on sessions.

The SessionAuth class is expected to implement session-based
    authentication methods in future updates.
