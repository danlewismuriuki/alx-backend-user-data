# alx-backend-user-data

## Project Overview

The `alx-backend-user-data` project focuses on handling and securing user data. This project is designed to teach and demonstrate key concepts related to data privacy, security practices, and authentication mechanisms.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- **Identify Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**: Understand and provide examples of PII, which includes any data that can be used to identify an individual. This could be names, email addresses, phone numbers, and other sensitive information.

- **Implement a Log Filter**: Create a log filter that obfuscates PII fields in logs. This ensures that sensitive information is not exposed in log files and helps maintain data privacy and security.

- **Encrypt Passwords**: Learn how to securely encrypt passwords. This includes understanding encryption techniques and validating the strength and integrity of passwords.

- **Authenticate to a Database**: Securely authenticate to a database using environment variables. This practice ensures that sensitive connection details are kept secure and are not hard-coded into the application.

## Features

- **Log Filtering**: Obfuscate sensitive fields in log messages to protect PII.
- **Password Encryption**: Implement encryption for storing and validating passwords securely.
- **Database Authentication**: Use environment variables for secure database authentication.

## Installation
