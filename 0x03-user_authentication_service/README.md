# Flask API Project

This project aims to teach you the basics of creating an API using the Flask web framework. By the end of this project, you will be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google, the following concepts:

- How to declare API routes in a Flask app
- How to get and set cookies
- How to retrieve request form data
- How to return various HTTP status codes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started with this project, you need to have Python and Flask installed. You can install Flask using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask
Project Structure
The project structure will look like this:

app.py: The main Flask application file.
templates/: Folder for HTML templates (if needed).
static/: Folder for static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
How to Declare API Routes in a Flask App
API routes are endpoints defined in your Flask application that clients can call to interact with your API. Here's how you can declare routes in Flask:

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Welcome to the Home Page!"

@app.route('/api/v1/resource', methods=['GET'])
def get_resource():
    return {"data": "Here is your resource"}, 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
@app.route('/'): Declares a route for the home page.
@app.route('/api/v1/resource', methods=['GET']): Declares a route for an API endpoint that responds to GET requests.
How to Get and Set Cookies
Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the client side that you can retrieve and manipulate in Flask.

Setting a Cookie
To set a cookie in a Flask response, use the set_cookie method:

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, make_response

@app.route('/set_cookie')
def set_cookie():
    response = make_response("Cookie is set")
    response.set_cookie('my_cookie', 'cookie_value')
    return response
Getting a Cookie
To retrieve a cookie from the request, use the request.cookies dictionary:

python
Copy code
from flask import request

@app.route('/get_cookie')
def get_cookie():
    cookie_value = request.cookies.get('my_cookie')
    return f'The value of my_cookie is: {cookie_value}'
How to Retrieve Request Form Data
To retrieve form data sent with POST requests, use the request.form dictionary:

python
Copy code
from flask import request

@app.route('/submit_form', methods=['POST'])
def submit_form():
    name = request.form.get('name')
    email = request.form.get('email')
    return f'Received form data: Name - {name}, Email - {email}'
request.form.get('name'): Retrieves form data sent with the key name.
request.form.get('email'): Retrieves form data sent with the key email.
How to Return Various HTTP Status Codes
In Flask, you can return different HTTP status codes along with your response to indicate the result of the request.

Examples:
200 OK: The request has succeeded.

python
Copy code
@app.route('/success')
def success():
    return "Success", 200
400 Bad Request: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.

python
Copy code
@app.route('/bad_request')
def bad_request():
    return "Bad Request", 400
404 Not Found: The server can not find the requested resource.

python
Copy code
@app.route('/not_found')
def not_found():
    return "Not Found", 404
500 Internal Server Error: The server has encountered a situation it doesn't know how to handle.

python
Copy code
@app.route('/server_error')
def server_error():
    return "Internal Server Error", 500
Conclusion
By working through this project, you will learn how to:

Declare and manage API routes in a Flask application.
Get and set cookies for client-side data storage.
Retrieve form data sent with HTTP requests.
Return different HTTP status codes to indicate the result of an API request.
These fundamental skills are essential for building robust and interactive web applications using Flask.
